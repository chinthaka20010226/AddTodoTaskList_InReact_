className={`secondary-btn ${isCompleted === false && `active`}`}


className=`{secondary-btn ${isCompleted === false && `active`}}`: 
This sets the base class of the element to secondary-btn. It seems like secondary-btn is a predefined class.

${isCompleted === false && active}: 
This part is a conditional expression. If isCompleted is equal to false, it adds the class active to the element.

So, if isCompleted is false, the element will have both secondary-btn and active classes. If isCompleted is not false, the element will only have the secondary-btn class.
